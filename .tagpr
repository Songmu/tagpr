# config file for the tagpr in git config format
# The tagpr generates the initial configuration, which you can rewrite to suit your environment.
# CONFIGURATIONS:
#   tagpr.releaseBranch
#       Generally, it is "main." It is the branch for releases. The tagpr tracks this branch,
#       creates or updates a pull request as a release candidate, or tags when they are merged.
#
#   tagpr.versionFile
#       A versioning file containing the semantic version needed to be updated at release.
#       It will be synchronized with the "git tag".
#       Often this is a meta-information file such as gemspec, setup.cfg, package.json, etc.
#       Sometimes the source code file, such as version.go or Bar.pm, is used.
#       If you do not want to use versioning files but only git tags, specify the "-" string here.
#
#   tagpr.vPrefix
#       Flag whether or not v-prefix is added to semver when git tagging. (e.g. v1.2.3 if true)
